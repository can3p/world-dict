The idea is to create universal wiki like way to create opensource crowdsourced bilingual dictionaries.

Currently most of the people rely on the proprietary translation technologies like Google Translate. While it's
free for all, it's not open-source and people do not have any access to translation data bases. The idea is
to find a way to crowdsource such databases or try to use existing text with translations to create them.
